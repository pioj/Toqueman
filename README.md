Unity3D Multi-Touch&Swipe library for leverage some challenges when creating a Mobile Game.

(*Please note this is a just an Input wrapper, you still need to interface the code with your game somehow...*)



### Why

Only for learning purposes. I need a generic way to detect and use multiple touches or swipes, yet trying to come with a generic way to handle them, for different videogame genres.



### Author

Just me.



### Current Features

- Up to **4** simultaneous touches or swipes.
- Exposes all data that is considered relevant to your needs.



### Planned features

- Include some test scenes as templates for different mobile games.
- Limit the touch/swipe area to a square/rectangle/circle area.
- Smart-detecting when a Player changes the type of Input (*i.e. Touch->GUI*), to prevent dirty coding.
- Async-like co-routine methods for leverage some cpu cycles.



### Usage

1. Import the last release of the .unitypackage to your project, or just get the raw .cs file.
2. Attach as a Component to a empty GameObject, then configure your settings.
3. ???
4. Profit!!
